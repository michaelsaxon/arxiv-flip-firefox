# arXiv Flip Firefox

Tired of being sent links to a pdf on arXiv when you want the abstract? Tired of getting sent to an abstract page and having to mouse all the way over to "Download PDF" when you just want to read the paper? This is a simple extension, ripped off from the [Mozilla webextensions example "commands"](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/commands), that allows you to set a keyboard shortcut to toggle between the /abs/ and /pdf/ pages of an active arXiv page in Firefox.

## Installation

1. Download the packaged extension from this repo
  i. Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/michaelsaxon/arxiv-flip-firefox/releases)
  ii. Download the latest .xpi file (signed Firefox extension)
2. Manually install the file in Firefox
  i. Navigate to the [about:addons](about:addons) page
  ii. Click the gear icon in the top right corner
  iii. Click "Install add-on from file"
  iv. Select the downloaded .xpi file (e.g. arxiv_flip-1.0-fx.xpi)
