# arXiv Flip Firefox

Tired of being sent links to a pdf on arXiv when you want the abstract? Tired of getting sent to an abstract page and having to mouse all the way over to "Download PDF" when you just want to read the paper? This is a simple extension, ripped off from the [Mozilla webextensions example "commands"](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/commands), that allows you to set a keyboard shortcut to toggle between the /abs/ and /pdf/ pages of an active arXiv page in Firefox.

  1. Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/michaelsaxon/arxiv-flip-firefox/releases)
